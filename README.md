Mungus 2: The Sussening

I made this game because my friends requested it often. Sometimes it makes me question my sanity.
> There is no installer yet, so please follow the instructions below to install it.

Download all of the source code into a program files or other install folder. This is where all game data will be stored.

Next, right click on **Mungus 2.exe** and click **Create shortcut**.
Now, move the shortcut to your desktop.

It is fairly simple to install, but an installer is planned soon.

I think the webhook is working now.
